    <h1>Death Stranding</h1>
    <p>
      Surrounded by death, Sam Bridges must confront a world completely transformed by the Death Stranding (an
      apocalyptic
      event). Carrying the last hopes of a future, Sam embarks on a journey to rebuild the annihilated world, one step
      at a
      time. It is a game about rebuilding the world after a mysterious cataclysm. About trying to create connections in
      an
      empty, divided, and inherently hostile environment. About helping and relying on people you have never seen or
      will see,
      and how sometimes this help can be rewarded in unexpected ways.

    <h1>Gameplay</h1>
    <p>
      The concept of the "strand game" introduced by Hideo Kojima emphasizes the importance of connectivity between
      players.
      Structures and resources left by other players can be shared, facilitating the protagonist's traversal. The use of
      advanced equipment, such as the backpack with stabilizers, motorized exoskeleton, and "baby pod" devices, adds
      complexity and innovation to the gameplay. Additionally, environmental challenges and supernatural creatures known
      as
      BTs maintain constant tension, contributing to an engaging and unique gaming experience.
